LHC ANOMALY DETECTION: 
This web application detects anomalies in Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiment data using machine learning. The app provides interactive visualizations to help identify unusual patterns in the data. With an enhanced UI/UX and real-time anomaly detection, this tool is designed for researchers and enthusiasts exploring high-energy physics data.  

Features:
1. Upload CSV datasets for anomaly detection  
2. Dynamic anomaly score calculation with adjustable threshold  
3. Interactive histogram for anomaly score distribution  
4. Circle chart displaying anomaly percentage  
5. 3D anomaly scatter plot toggle with real-time visualization  
6. Smooth animations, sliding text, and custom styling  
7. Fully responsive and optimized UI  

Source of Database:
The dataset used for this app is from Kaggle, but you can use any dataset for anomaly detection.  

Tech Stack:
- Python  
- Streamlit  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Plotly  
- HTML & CSS (for UI enhancements)
